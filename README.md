Stage 1:

**Food Catalogue**

The Food Catalogue feature presents a user-friendly interface showcasing all the NP Food courts using a RecyclerView. Users can easily choose their preferred food court, and the app will display the food stalls available in that particular court.

**Food Court Crowdedness**

Users can view the real-time crowdedness level of each food court. Inside a food court, users have the option to provide information on how crowded it is, rating the status of the foodcourts. This data is then shared with other users who are looking for less crowded places to dine. If no data is available, the app will display the crowdedness as "unknown."

Stage 2:

**Rating of Food**

**Wishlist with Notifications**

Users can add their desired foods to a wishlist for future reference. Around lunchtime, the app sends a food suggestion notification with a randomly generated food item, prompting users to consider it for their meal. The notification includes information about the food court where the dish can be found and its name. The main page may feature an image view that changes daily, reminding users to try new foods soon.
