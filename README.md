Stage 1:

**Food Catalogue**

The Food Catalogue feature presents a user-friendly interface showcasing all the NP Food courts using a RecyclerView. Users can easily choose their preferred food court, and the app will display the food stalls available in that particular court.

**Food Court Crowdedness**

Users can view the real-time crowdedness level of each food court. Inside a food court, users have the option to provide information on how crowded it is, rating it on a scale of 1 to 10. This data is then shared with other users who are looking for less crowded places to dine. If no data is available, the app will display the crowdedness as "unknown."

**NP Food Courts Map**

The NP Food Courts Map provides a visual representation of NP, displaying the locations of each food court. Users can also view their current location and facing direction, making it easier to navigate and reach their desired food court.

**Login Page**

The Login Page allows users to access their accounts. Newcomers can register by providing basic information such as a username, name, and student ID. Upon registration, a user profile will be created, enabling a personalized app experience. Logging into the app requires a username and password.

**Limit Options**

Food options are categorized into different categories for easy navigation. Users can select a category to view the listed food options in a RecyclerView.

Stage 2:

**Rating of Food**

Users can rate the dishes they have tried, providing a range from 1 to 5 stars and a short review explaining their rating. The ratings and reviews are visible to other users, helping them make informed decisions about their food choices. Users can also include a photo of the food along with their review.

**Wishlist with Notifications**

Users can add their desired foods to a wishlist for future reference. Around lunchtime, the app sends a food suggestion notification with a randomly generated food item, prompting users to consider it for their meal. The notification includes information about the food court where the dish can be found and its name. The main page may feature an image view that changes daily, reminding users to try new foods soon.

**All-Time Favorite Page**

The All-Time Favorite page showcases a collection of the top 10 favorite foods. Users can browse through the displayed information about each food item in a RecyclerView format. Clicking on a food item provides detailed information, and users can choose to add it to their wishlist for future reference.
