Stage 1:

**Food Catalogue**

The Food Catalogue feature presents a user-friendly interface showcasing all the NP Food courts using a RecyclerView. Users can easily choose their preferred food court, and the app will display the food stalls available in that particular court.

**Food Court Crowdedness**

Users can view the real-time crowdedness level of each food court. Inside a food court, users have the option to provide information on how crowded it is, rating the status of the foodcourts. This data is then shared with other users who are looking for less crowded places to dine. If no data is available, the app will display the crowdedness as "unknown". The collected data would then be averaged to show the mean crowd level for each food court.

**NP Food Courts Map**

The NP Food Courts Map provides a visual representation of NP, displaying the locations of each food court. Users can also view their current location and facing direction, making it easier to navigate and reach their desired food court.

Stage 2:

**Rating of Food**

Users can rate the dishes they have tried, providing a range from 1 to 5 stars and a short review explaining their rating. The ratings and reviews are visible to other users, helping them make informed decisions about their food choices. Users can also include a photo of the food along with their review. Other users can view every review made, along with the average rating, and also sort the reviews by date, highest rated, and lowest rated.

**Wishlist**

Users can add their desired foods to a wishlist for future reference. Around lunchtime, the app sends a food suggestion notification with a randomly generated food item, prompting users to consider it for their meal. The notification includes information about the food court where the dish can be found and its name. The main page may feature an image view that changes daily, reminding users to try new foods soon.

**Notifications**

When it hits 12pm, users will receive a notification reminding them that it's time for lunch! This will not only ensure that users eat on time but it also encourages users to click on the app and browse their food options. Imagine how much time the notification saves them as after class they can run straight to their preferred food court and eat instead of having to decide for another 10 minutes.

**Information Page**

The information page shows information about all the foodcourts available at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. It would include general details like opening and closing timings. This will allow students to have all this information at the tip of their fingers instead of being confused.

**Profile Page**

The profile page allows users to change their username and password easily. Some users might not like the name they created at the start and might want something different, hence, this feature allows them to do so easily, as long as the name has not been taken up. Other users might wish to change their passwords for additional security which can also be easily done as long as they remember their current password.

**Food Generator Page**

The food generator page generates random food on click. For students who have trouble deciding on what to eat every day, they can use this feature to plan on what to have that day!
